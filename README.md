#Hi there :wave: My name is Jonathan, current IÂ´m in Colombia.

As a software dreamer and doer :fireworks:, I excel at turning ideas into reality with agile methodologies like SCRUM. With a keen eye for managing teams and overcoming roadblocks, I bring deep knowledge of software development to every project I touch. 

My passion for technology started at a young age, and I quickly became a self-taught web developer, creating websites for friends and family. Fast forward to today, and I'm a Systems and Computing Engineer and a Jedi Knight :smirk:, using my skills to build cutting-edge solutions and conquer the galaxy (well, maybe just the tech world for now). Let's talk about how I can bring my experience and creativity to your team!
